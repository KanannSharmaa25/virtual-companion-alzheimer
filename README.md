🧠 Virtual Companion for Alzheimer’s Patients

An AI-powered, role-based healthcare application designed to assist Alzheimer’s patients with daily routines, safety, and emotional support, while enabling caregivers and family members to monitor patient activity, location, and health insights in real time.

📌 Project Description

The Virtual Companion for Alzheimer’s Patients bridges the gap between traditional ICT-based care systems and intelligent, AI-driven daily assistance. The application is designed with a strong focus on patient safety, caregiver control, and calm, accessible UI/UX suitable for individuals with cognitive impairment.

The system supports two user roles—Patient and Caregiver—and dynamically adapts features based on the selected role. Once a user logs in, the app remembers their role and profile, ensuring a smooth and stress-free experience during subsequent sessions.
